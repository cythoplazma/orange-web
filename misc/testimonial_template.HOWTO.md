Testimonial Template HOWTO
==========================

The [XCF file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCF_%28file_format%29) is GIMP's native image editing format. GIMP is open-source image editing software.

Short instructions on how to add a drop shadow to future testimonial images:

1. Open the XCF file with GIMP.
2. Select the bottom Layer (the one with the image of a person).
3. Replace the image by deleting it and copy-pasting a new one.
4. Scale this Layer. We can do so under `Tools->Transform Tools->Scale`. We scale the image so that the face fits inside the circle, which is one of the upper Layers.
5. Crop the Canvas to the edges of the circle. Make sure that the selection's aspect ratio is fixed (dimensions should be 1:1).
6. Resize to arbitrary dimensions (preferably to 550px width and height) and export to PNG, or JPG at 92% compression.
