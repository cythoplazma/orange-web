Idea description
================
The idea is centered around crowdsourcing labor for tagging large datasets. The web application would be optimized for fast and efficient tagging and classification, using the latest web technologies. The experience flow for regular users, or Collaborators, is fairly straight-forward:

1. User joins a project listed on the application's website
2. User is presented with a dataset, broken down into text or single images
3. User tags the data according to the project's goals
4. The user can export the entirety of the project's crowdsourcing effort, no matter at which point in time, and request the end classification model from the project's Manager

Project Managers would be able to:

1. Create new projects
2. Promote their efforts
3. Upload their data in a predefined format or retrieve it via web APIs
4. Export the crowdsourcing effort and use it to build a classification model, which they would be required to share with their Collaborators

The main focus will be put on the site functioning efficiently on mobile devices, while trying to pack as much features into what would be presented as a simple tagging interface.
