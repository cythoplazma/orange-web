Idea description
================
The idea is centered around crowdsourcing labor for tagging large datasets. The web application would be optimized for fast and efficient tagging and classification, using the latest web technologies. The experience flow for regular users, or Collaborators, is fairly straight-forward:

1. User joins a project listed on the application's website
2. User is presented with a dataset, broken down into text or single images
3. User tags the data according to the project's goals
4. The user can export the entirety of the project's crowdsourcing effort, regardless of point in time, and request the end classification model from the project's Manager

Project Managers would be able to:

1. Create new projects and promote their efforts to the public
2. Upload their data in a predefined format, or retrieve it via web APIs (optional)
3. Export the fruits of Collaborators' efforts and use the tags to build a classification model (with their own resources), which they would be required to share with the project's Collaborators

Development will focus on the application having smooth mobile device performance, while trying to pack as much features into what would be presented as a simple tagging interface.
